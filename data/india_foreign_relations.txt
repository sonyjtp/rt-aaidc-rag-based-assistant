Summary: This document explores India's foreign relations spanning diplomatic engagement with global powers, regional neighbors, international organizations, and emerging economies, examining strategic partnerships, geopolitical challenges, soft power projection, and India's evolving role in international affairs.

India's foreign relations reflect the subcontinent's position as emerging global power, regional South Asian leader, and significant participant in international affairs. The postcolonial foreign policy established principles of non-alignment, strategic autonomy, and peaceful coexistence guiding diplomatic engagement across decades. India's bilateral relationships with major powers including the United States, China, Russia, and Japan establish framework for strategic partnerships and geopolitical competition. The South Asian regional relationships encompassing Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and other neighbors generate both cooperation and tensions through territorial disputes, water-sharing conflicts, and communal concerns. India's participation in international organizations including the United Nations, World Trade Organization, and regional forums establishes frameworks for multilateral engagement. The soft power projection through cultural diplomacy, film industry, philosophical traditions, and spiritual influence extends India's international presence beyond formal diplomacy. Contemporary foreign policy addresses challenges including managing great power competition, resolving regional conflicts, pursuing economic development, and addressing climate change. The balance between strategic autonomy and alliance commitments, between regional leadership and global participation, and between national interest and international cooperation remains central to Indian foreign policy. Understanding India's foreign relations illuminates processes of postcolonial state-building, emerging power dynamics, and the complex navigation of international relationships within multipolar global system. The future of Indian foreign policy depends on maintaining strategic autonomy, deepening strategic partnerships, and effectively addressing transnational challenges requiring international cooperation.
