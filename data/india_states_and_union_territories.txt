Summary: This document explores India's complex administrative organization encompassing 28 states and 8 union territories, examining their historical formation, geographical characteristics, economic profiles, cultural distinctiveness, and roles within India's federal framework.

India's administrative organization comprises 28 states and 8 union territories establishing a complex federal structure accommodating regional diversity within unified national framework.
