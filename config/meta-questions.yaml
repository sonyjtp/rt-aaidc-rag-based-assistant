# Meta-question patterns for system/assistant queries (NOT domain queries)
# Key principle: Disambiguate by requiring explicit project context (you/your/this/system)
# Examples:
#   ✅ "What is your architecture?" → Meta-question (explicit: "your")
#   ✅ "What is this application?" → Meta-question (explicit: "this")
#   ❌ "What is Indian architecture?" → Domain query (no "your/this/system")
#   ❌ "Tell me about India" → Domain query (not "yourself/project/system")
